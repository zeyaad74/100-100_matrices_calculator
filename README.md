# 100-100_matrices_calculator
## Project Description
It is required to develop a program to do Matrix operations (Plus to another
Matrix, Minus to another matrix, Multiply to another matrix, power, transpose, determinant, inverse, divide by another matrix). The program use a defined string format to represent the matrix in the user input and output
sections and the format is : [10 2.13 3;-5 0 4;16.5 1 8].
## General Constraints
1- User can input matrices of any size up to 100 x 100.
2- All values are of float data types.
4- Any error in user input, the program should output the word “ERROR”
in uppercase letters and exits. List of Errors includes the following:
    a. Any missing or unexpected input in the entered string matrix.
    b. Invalid corresponding matrices size in +, -, * , / operators.
    c. Non square matrix in Inverse and Power operators.
    d. Non integer positive power in power operator.
## note
The matrix.cpp file includes the program code for all operations.
The Complex.cpp file i tried to do + , - , * operations on complex matrices.
